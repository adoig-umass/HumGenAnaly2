# Thank you for helping streamline this tool!

I have been wanting to use github to track my data analysis. Regrettably, I am a seriously disorganized mind and anything that can be done to streamline tools and keep things flowing is useful. Integrating github directly into Rstudio is awesome.

Previously I had downloaded the desktop tool also, and its ability to seamlessly push material copied into the relevant directory is super useful. I hope to use this in my research.
